# 🎥 Adding Video Surprise to Your Birthday Website

The surprise section can now show a special birthday video! Here's how to add your own video:

## 📹 Video File Setup

### Quick Start
1. Get your birthday video file (MP4 format recommended)
2. Name it `birthday-video.mp4`
3. Copy it to your website folder (same location as `index.html`)
4. The website will automatically detect and show the video!

### Supported Formats
- **MP4** (recommended) - works on all devices
- **WebM** (optional) - smaller file size, good for web

### File Requirements
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec) or WebM
- **Size**: Under 50MB for good loading performance
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or lower (1280x720 works great)
- **Duration**: 1-5 minutes recommended
- **File name**: Must be exactly `birthday-video.mp4`

## 🎬 Video Ideas

### Personal Messages
- Family members saying happy birthday
- Compilation of birthday wishes
- A personal message from parents/siblings
- Grandparents sharing memories

### Memory Videos
- Photo slideshow with music
- Video compilation from past birthdays
- Family vacation highlights
- Growing up moments

### Creative Videos
- Surprise announcement (trip, gift, etc.)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Video Available**: Shows video player with controls + option to show text message
2. **No Video**: Automatically shows the beautiful text message and balloons
3. **Video Fails**: Falls back gracefully to text message

### User Experience

- "▶️ Play Special Message" button to start video

- Both video AND text message can be shown together

2. Keep it steady (use a tripod if possible)
3. Good lighting makes a huge difference
4. Keep audio clear - speak close to phone

## 🎨 Adding a Video Thumbnail

You can add a custom thumbnail image:
1. Create/edit an image (1280x720 pixels)
2. Save as `video-thumbnail.jpg`
3. Add to your website folder
4. The video will show this image before playing

To enable the thumbnail, edit `index.html` and change:
```html
<video id="surpriseVideo" controls preload="metadata" poster="">
```
to:
```html
<video id="surpriseVideo" controls preload="metadata" poster="video-thumbnail.jpg">
```

## 🚀 Testing Your Video

1. Start your local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open the website in your browser
3. Navigate to the surprise section
4. Click "Click to Reveal"
5. Your video should appear with play controls!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Video not showing?**
- Check file name is exactly `birthday-video.mp4`
- Ensure file is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Try a different browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

**Video won't play?**
- File might be corrupted - try re-exporting
- Format might not be supported - convert to MP4
- File might be too large - compress it
- Browser might block autoplay - this is normal, user must click play

**Only text showing?**
- This means the video file wasn't found
- Check file name and location
- The website gracefully falls back to text message

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test early**: Add your video and test it before the big day
2. **Have a backup**: The text message is always there as fallback
3. **Short is better**: 2-3 minutes keeps people engaged
4. **Audio matters**: Make sure voices are clear
5. **Mobile first**: Test on phones - most people will view on mobile

## 🎊 Advanced: Multiple Videos

Want multiple videos? You can create a playlist by:
1. Adding multiple video files: `birthday-video1.mp4`, `birthday-video2.mp4`
2. Editing the JavaScript to cycle through them
3. Contact support if you need help with this!
